                <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
                  <p>The largest alliance dedicated to children and youth started with a simple idea. Businessman and former Michigan Governor George Romney believed the nation faced “vitally serious social problems” that threatened our children’s lives and our future.</p>
                  <p>Reversal, he wrote, required an urgent, “full-scale mobilization of the entire nation.” In 1995, Governor Romney shared the idea of a presidents’ summit with Harris Wofford, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service, and Bob Goodwin, CEO of Points of Light.</p>
                  <p>Governor Romney died before his dream could become reality. At his funeral, Lenore Romney, George’s widow, asked Wofford if he would pursue her husband’s plans for a national summit. Wofford made a promise: “We will make it happen.” </p>

                  <p>The Presidents’ Summit began as one person’s idea, but it quickly became a partnership, an alliance to lift up, magnify and accelerate the work of all.</p>
                  <p>Points of Light and the Corporation for National and Community Service helped organize the Summit and brought strengths in citizen service. As the gathering took shape with its focus on children and youth, Communities In Schools, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, the United Way of America and MENTOR joined the team.</p>
                  <p>These six founding organizations in turn leveraged their national networks, organized delegations and mobilized others — activities that became hallmarks of Alliance partners and began to give America’s Promise the reach and strength to support communities in the years to come.</p>

                  <p>The Presidents’ summit developed into America’s Promise Alliance in recognition that answering the call to improve the lives’ of America’s youth was going to be a sustained effort living well beyond that day in 1997. The name “America’s Promise” came from Dr. Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech in which Dr.t King compared the Constitution and Declaration of Independence to a promissory note.</p>
                  <p>“The note,” Dr. King said, “was a promise that all men — yes, black men as well as white men — would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”</p>
                  <p>That solemn promise of a nation, as yet unfilled, lay at the heart of the presidents’ call to action for America’s young people, and to the creation and naming of America’s Promise.</p>

                  <p>Retired Gen. Colin L. Powell became America's Promise's Founding Chairman - leading the movement that arose from the Presidents’ Summit. Both General Powell and his wife, Alma, were highly respected as advocates for children and as leaders who transcend partisan politics. That respect, in turn, aided the effort to enlist alliance partners that would be essential to the cause. Impressed by the zeal of those who joined the effort, General Powell was eager to launch the campaign. “It’s good to have an army again,” he said.</p>
                  <p>Today, Alma Powell serves as Chair of America's Promise. As Mrs. Powell has told audiences across the country, her grandfather was born into slavery, and her grandmother was born just after slavery ended. Against enormous odds, both earned college degrees — then saw their five children through college, too. In the process, they altered the course of her family.</p>
                  <p>For adults and children alike, Mrs. Powell’s story is a testament to the truths that are essential to our work: History is not destiny and education builds pathways.</p>
